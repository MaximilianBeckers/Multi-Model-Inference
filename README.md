# Multi-Model-Inference

Author: Maximilian Beckers

This is a program to classify multiple structures of a protein. Dimensionality reductions are also done and images of the resulting 2D embeddings are shown.

To run the script, you just have to run:

    python run.py -pdbs model_1.pdb model_2.pdb
  
R-code from exploratory studies is also provided.
